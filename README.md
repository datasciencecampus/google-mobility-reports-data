Archive of data related to the Google [Community Mobility Reports](https://www.google.com/covid19/mobility/) published 03/04/2020

This repository contains data extracted from [Google Community Mobility Reports](https://www.google.com/covid19/mobility/) published on the 03/04/2020, together with supporting boundaries based on the current UK administrative geography to allow mapping and linking with other sources of data. 

## Boundary data
The set of boundaries provided in the geopackage is draft, and has been created by ONS in order to promote information sharing and analysis of the effect of COVID19.

The boundaries have been tailored specifically to present ‘Community Mobility’ data (first published by Google on 3 April 2020) recast to administrative boundaries. 
  
The data published by Google covers all of the UK based on the normal Government Statistical  Service (GSS) assignment to 2019 administrative areas - with 3 exceptions. The Unitary Authorities of Bournemouth, Christchurch and Poole; Nottingham; and Telford and Wrekin are missing. In building the boundaries provided here we have assumed that Google have included data for these missing areas within Dorset, Nottinghamshire and Shropshire. Although they do not reflect the current administrative geography we have made use of Ceremonial County versions of Dorset, Nottinghamshire and Shropshire to ensure full geographic coverage of the UK. These boundaries do not reflect current administrative boundaries so care should be taken in how they are used and they should only be used to understand the results published by Google. Further versions of these boundaries may be made available if we are able confirm more details but they are provided here in the hope that they will be helpful to others. 


## Mid-year population estimates
The [2018 mid-year population estimates for the UK](https://www.ons.gov.uk/peoplepopulationandcommunity/populationandmigration/populationestimates/bulletins/annualmidyearpopulationestimates/mid2018) have been linked to the custom lookup created by ONS. A Standard Area Measurement based on those [produced by ONS Geography](https://geoportal.statistics.gov.uk/search?collection=Dataset&sort=name&tags=all(PRD_SAM) ) has also been included for each area (calculated in hectares). This allows measures such as population density to be calculated.
